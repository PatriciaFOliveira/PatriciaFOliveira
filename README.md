Hi, Iâ€™m Patricia! Currently starting my journey to become a developer. A couple years ago I got to do a short Python course and helped in a project for the company I work at but then didn't keep working on it so here I am now ðŸ˜Š 

Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

I'm excited to be able to be in a community of like minded people that share the same interest in learning. 

On my free time I like to read, crochet and go on long long walks ðŸ¤—
